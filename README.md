# Description
This is a food application called What's for Dinner where you can click a button to get a random recipe and you can click a button to generate a random beer. This app is good for home cooks or anybody who is learning how to cook that like to try new recipes and drinks for fun. We wanted this to be fun and inclusive to everybody because who doesn't love to eat!
